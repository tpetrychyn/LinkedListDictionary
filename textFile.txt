(100 marks) In this problem, you are required to write a program that searches for a pattern
of characters in a text file. A pattern is either a literal
string or else a string that contains magic characters. A literal string is simply a sequence of characters
that does not
contain any magic characters. For example,
the pattern “CS115 is a prerequisite” is a literal
string. Magic characters consist of the characters ‘*’ and ‘?’. For example,
the pattern “CS* is a
pre?equisite” is not a literal string. The ‘*’character is a wildcard character for
matching many characters and indicates that any sequence of characters
in the text file beginning with the characters “CS”, followed by one or more characters, and ending
with the ‘ ’ character, is considered a match for the
pattern “CS* ”.
Thus, all of “CS210 ”, “CSSSS ”, “CS  ”, and “CS#q$U@m ” match the pattern.
The ‘?’ character is a wild card character for matching a single character and indicates that any
sequence of characters in the text
file beginning with the characters “CS* is a pre” followed by any single
character is considered a match for the pattern “CS* is a pre?”. Thus, all of “CS* is a 
prer”, “CS* is a pre8”, and “CS* is a preZ”, and “CS* is a pre&” match the pattern.

Your program should use the following general algorithm:

Open the pattern file
Read the first line of the pattern file into the pattern buffer
While not at the end of the pattern file
    Open the text file
    Read the first line of the text file into the text buffer
    While not at the end of the text file
        Report each position in the text buffer where a pattern buffer match can be found
        Read the next line of the text file into the text buffer
    Close the text file
    Read the next line of the pattern file into the pattern buffer
Close the pattern file

The following is a brute force pattern matching algorithm:

m = the length of the pattern buffer
n = the length of the text buffer
For i = 0 to n – m
    j = 0
    While j < m
        If pattern buffer [j] == ‘*’
            k = i + j
            j ++
            If j < m
                While k < n
                    If text buffer [k] == pattern buffer [j]
                        j ++
                        Break
                    Else
                        k ++
                If k == n
                    Break
        Else if pattern buffer [j] == ‘?’
            j ++
        Else if text buffer [i + j] == pattern buffer [j]
            j ++
    If j == m
        Report i	// match found at position i in text buffer

The pattern and text buffers should be
declared as variables of an unsorted array-based list type defined
as a C++ class. Your C++ class should be an implementation of the unsorted array-based
list algorithms given on the CS210 Algorithms web page.

Do not waste your time implementing any unsorted array-based list algorithms that you don’t actually need.

When you are ready to demonstrate that your program works, use the files
textFile and patternFile from
the directory /home/venus/hilder/cs210/assignment4/datafiles as input to your program.

If you are working alone,
submit the following to UR Courses zipped into a single file:
(1) the source code for all your .cpp and .h files and
(2) a script file showing the compilation and execution of your program.

If you are working with a partner,
one of the partners should submit the following to UR Courses zipped into a single file:
(1) the source code for all your .cpp and .h files and
(2) a script file showing the compilation and execution of your program.
Both partners should submit to UR Courses:
(1) a file named partners that provides the names and student numbers of the partners.
